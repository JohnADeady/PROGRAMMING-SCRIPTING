# Programming and Scritping Module 

This repository contains assignments for semster one of Data Analytics from GMIT. There are a total of 11 programs where I will go into more detail below. The main purpose of these assignments is to understand and write programs using the [Python](https://www.python.org/). Python is an interpreted high-level programming language for general-purpose programming.(ref Wkipedia)

## Getting Starting
[Python](https://www.python.org/) is receommended to run these programs. In order to get started we must download [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) and then [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) is a free and open source distribution of the Python and R programming languages for large-scale data processing, predictive analytics, and scientific computing, that aims to simplify package management and deployment.

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). is a source code editor developed by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS. It includes support for debugging, embedded Git control, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, and code refactoring. (ref Wikipedia)

#### Installing Downloads
Step by sted guide for downloading [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/):
1. Open Anaconda Download
2. Click Python 3.6 version
3. Follow the instructions on screen - unsure about settings accept the default settings.
4. Once completed test installation

Step by sted guide for downloading [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
1. Open VS Studio Download
2. Depending on your OS system - click the appropriate one ie Windows, Mac.
3. Follow the instructions on screen - unsure about settings accept the default settings.
4. Once completed run a simple program 

## Assignment One (Week 1: 22-01-2018 to 28-01-2018)
Calculate the nth Fibonacci number.Fibonacci series is a series of numbers in which each number ( Fibonacci number ) is the sum of the two preceding numbers. The simplest is the series 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, etc.(ref Wikipedia). Change the program to calculate the nth Fibonacci number where n the sum of the first and last letters of your first name as numbers. Take A as the number 1, B as 2, C as 3, and so on. For example, my name is Ian, so I should calculate the 25th Fibonacci number because I is 9 and n is 14, giving 25 in total. Once you calculate the right Fibonacci number for your own name, please post it to the Discussions forum on this page as per my post there.

## Assignment Two (Week 2: 29-01-2018 to 04-02-2018)
Calculate the nth Fibonacci number.Fibonacci series is a series of numbers in which each number ( Fibonacci number ) is the sum of the two preceding numbers. The simplest is the series 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, etc.(ref Wikipedia). Change the string variable to contain your own surname, and rerun it
